INSTITUTIONAL-GRADE ANALYSIS REQUIREMENTS:
You must ensure the analysis covers ALL these critical dimensions with ZERO gaps:

FINANCIAL ANALYSIS COMPLETENESS CHECK:
□ Current valuation metrics (P/E, P/B, EV/EBITDA, PEG, Price/Sales)
□ 5-year historical financial performance trends
□ Revenue growth sustainability and drivers
□ Profitability margins (Gross, Operating, Net) analysis
□ Balance sheet strength (Debt/Equity, Current Ratio, Quick Ratio)
□ Cash flow generation (Operating, Free Cash Flow, FCF yield)
□ Capital allocation efficiency (ROIC, ROE, ROA)
□ Dividend policy and shareholder return history

MARKET & COMPETITIVE ANALYSIS CHECK:
□ Industry growth prospects and market size
□ Competitive positioning and market share trends
□ Key competitors comparison and benchmarking
□ Regulatory environment and compliance risks
□ Management quality and strategic execution
□ ESG factors and sustainability metrics
□ Technology disruption and innovation risks

CURRENT MARKET DYNAMICS CHECK:
□ Recent earnings results and guidance updates
□ Analyst consensus and price target changes
□ Institutional investor sentiment and activity
□ Recent news catalysts and developments
□ Regulatory changes affecting the sector
□ Macroeconomic factors and sector rotation
□ Options flow and technical analysis signals

RISK ASSESSMENT COMPLETENESS CHECK:
□ Business model risks and vulnerabilities
□ Financial leverage and liquidity risks
□ Operational and execution risks
□ Regulatory and compliance risks
□ Market and competitive risks
□ ESG and reputational risks
□ Scenario analysis (bull/base/bear cases)

CRITICAL GAP IDENTIFICATION STRATEGY:
1. Scan summaries for missing quantitative metrics
2. Identify absent qualitative analysis components
3. Check for outdated information (>6 months old)
4. Verify comprehensive risk coverage
5. Ensure multi-dimensional perspective coverage
6. Validate institutional-grade depth and rigor

GAP PRIORITIZATION:
- CRITICAL: Missing core financial metrics or recent earnings
- HIGH: Absent competitive analysis or risk assessment
- MEDIUM: Missing ESG factors or regulatory context
- LOW: Supplementary industry context or historical data

RESPONSE CRITERIA:
- If ANY critical or high-priority gaps exist → Identify specific tools needed
- If analysis lacks institutional depth → Request deeper research
- If information is outdated → Request current data
- Only return "NONE" if analysis truly meets institutional standards

RESPONSE FORMAT:
CRITICAL: You MUST respond with ONLY one of these two formats:

1. If you find ANY significant gaps, return ONLY this JSON object (no other text):
{{
  "tools": ["TOOL_NAME1", "TOOL_NAME2"],
  "queries": {{
    "TOOL_NAME1": "highly specific query targeting the exact gap",
    "TOOL_NAME2": "complementary query for comprehensive coverage"
  }}
}}

2. If analysis truly meets institutional standards with NO gaps, return ONLY:
NONE

DO NOT include explanations, reasoning, or any other text. Return ONLY the JSON object or ONLY "NONE".

EXAMPLE GAP RESPONSES:
{{
  "tools": ["YAHOO_FINANCE", "NEWSDATA"],
  "queries": {{
    "YAHOO_FINANCE": "Tesla detailed financial ratios debt analysis cash flow trends Q4 2024 earnings metrics",
    "NEWSDATA": "Tesla recent regulatory developments FSD approval China market expansion Musk management changes"
  }}
}}

QUALITY STANDARDS:
- Be EXTREMELY demanding - institutional clients expect perfection
- Identify gaps that retail analysis would miss
- Focus on material information that affects investment decisions
- Prioritize recent, actionable intelligence
- Ensure multi-source validation of critical facts

Remember: A single missing critical component can invalidate an entire investment thesis. Be thorough and uncompromising.`;
